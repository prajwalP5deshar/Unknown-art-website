       <h1>the art of letting go</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Letting go of the feeling you once had for someone
            forgetting their smiles, their eyes, their cheeks
            and most importantly their words
            looking at those beautiful eyes of her change
            never knowing; why they changed?
            it is called <span style="color: chartreuse;">"the art of letting go"</span>
        </p>

    <div class="box2">
        <h1>admiration</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Sometime's one can 
            only admire the beauty 
            from a distance.</p>

        <h1>faith</h1>
        <br>
        <p>"The darker the night, the brighter the stars,
            the deeper the grief, the closer is <span style="color: aquamarine;">god</span>!"

    <div class="box4">
        <h1>validation</h1>
        <br>
       <pre><p>"We all love ourselves
more than other people...
but care more about
their opinion than our own."
it is if we have become actor's
more attuned to the 
reactions of the audience
than to the authenticity
of our own performance.
Therefore I say to you
find approval
from the integrity and strength
of our own character.
<span style="color:rgb(102, 102, 216);">THe validation that's both
 unwavering and true.</span>

    <div class="box5">
        <h1>priorities</h1>
        <br>
       <pre> <p> I'm actually in a period of my life 
where i'm a bit lost in fact i'm
not even sure if i'm sad because 
in the presence of others i laugh and talk
but as soon as i'm alone in my own home
i feel no emotion nothing 
i simply find myself face to face 
with my self  i  dive into my thoughts 
searching for a spark of clarity
i try to understand  this inner emptiness
this absence of emotion that sets in
<span style="color: cadetblue;">when distractions fade i realize that
sometimes silence and solitude are necessary
they force introspection</span> 
yes it's uncomfortable 
yes it's confusing
but maybe it's my mind's way  
it's time to take a moment for myself
maybe this aparent calm is an opportunity
to ask some fundamental questions
to reconsider what i really want to
redefine my <span style="color: chocolate;">priorities.</span></p></pre>
