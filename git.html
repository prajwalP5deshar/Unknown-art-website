when the truth offends,
we....
we lie and lie until
we can no longer remember
it is even there.
but it is ...
still there.
every lie we tell
incurs a debt to the truth.
sooner or later.
that debt is paid.

it doesn't matter losing 
the calmnesss and tranquility
of the  mind,
it doesn't matter even if  
the heart stops,
but in the process of  being
loved by you..
something precious to one's self 
has been lost which can never be 
found.

    </h1>

        <p>
The fragrance of someone's dress comes when it flies
The separation of your body is very painful
How do I feel without you?
How do you sleep without me?
Rishta-e-Dil Tere Zamane Mein
Rasm hi kya nibhani hoti
We smiled when we met him
I would be happy if I didn't cry
Don't have any trace of Jinn in your heart
Why didn't that color bloom on the face
Ab to khali hai rooh jazbon se
Abhi Kya Tabaz Se Na Mile

    <h1>
        reality
    </h1>
    <pre><p>
It's you. you're the problem
you think you're special,
but you're not.
So, it doesn't matter
what outfit you put on,
play dress up or what little lies
you tell your friends
or even lies you tell yourself.
At the end of the day,
you just make everything worse.
you lose. you're a loser. 
<!-- everytime we've ever found a you -->
<!-- problem is, -->

        <h1>
            feeling of belonging
        </h1>
        <pre><p>
If one could go anywhere 
in the world
with the snap of a 
finger one would
still feel the same,
of not belonging somewhere.
Cause that place is a 
person and not a destination.

                    <p>
life is precious cause 
you can't watch it again,

you can believe in afterlife 
if that's what makes you feel better
but once you realize 
you're not gonna be around forever
                        
I think that's what make's life so beautiful 
One day you'll eat your last med,
                        
Smell your last flower, 
hug your friend for the very last time;
                        
you might not know that it's the last time 
so you should do everything you love, 
treasure the few year's you've got.
